<img src="logo.png" width="500">

This repository contains coding problems used for the screening process in PFN (Preferred Networks) summer internship.

English and Japanese statements are available. The overview of the problems is as follows.

## 2018
The problem set in 2018 consists of five themes. Applicants needed to choose one of them according to the theme they have chosen.

- **Machine Learning/Mathematics**: You are asked to implement an algorithm of adversarial examples for some neural network model. You need to write a simple report on the performance of the algorithm as well.
- **Back-end**: You are asked to create a tool that analyzes log files.
- **Front-end**: You are asked to develop a prototype of an annotation tool for speech videos.
- **Processor/Compiler**: You are asked to optimize the code of matrix multiplication. Further, you need to design a hardware circuit of matrix multiplication.
- **Chainer**: You are asked to implement a training code for some model, using Chainer.

## 2017
The problem set in 2017 consists of four themes.

- **Machine Learning/Mathematics**: Reinforcement learning, Cartpole, Cross Entropy Method.
- **Back-end**: Implementation of 'ls' command.
- **Front-end**: Creation of search UI.
- **Chip**: Hardware circuit design.

## Old Problems (2011-2016)
`old` directory contains older problem sets, which were use also in the summer internship screening of PFI (Preferred Infrastructure, Inc.).
